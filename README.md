Simple vampire survivors clone game with multiplayer made with photon fusion plugin.
This project was created as part of my learning path and first acquaintance with Photon Fusion 2. Feel free to use it as learning example, or maybe for something else. 
All asynchronous logic made in simple way, using vanila c# tasks. It's unsafe practice and i use it only for simplification. 
Please if you'll be using this project for something, use unitasks instead.
